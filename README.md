# USCollegeLoansDashboard

Created a tableau dashboard that investigates the student loans created by the colleges in the U.S.

---
 
You can access the dashboard posted on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jay.patel5526/viz/college_loans2/FinalDB2?publish=yes)

There are 2 Navigational Dashboards links:
1. Undergraduate Navigational Button shows the college loans created for undergrads.
2. Graduate Navigational Button shows the college loans created for grads.

The original dataset and viz can be access by clicking [here](https://howmuch.net/sources/university-with-the-most-student-loan-originations-in-every-state) or on the Department of Education button on the top right corner of the dashboard.

The two images in the repo are screenshots of the two dashboard pages.
